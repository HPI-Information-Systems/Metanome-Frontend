# Metanome Frontend

The frontend is part of the [Metanome project](https://hpi.de/naumann/projects/data-profiling-and-analytics/metanome-data-profiling.html)
which is a joint project between the Hasso-Plattner-Institute ([HPI](http://www.hpi.de)) and the Qatar Computing Research Institute ([QCRI](http://www.qcri.org)).
The frontend enables users to interact with the [Metanome platform](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome).
